# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the UI Android-friendly with responsive chat, scrollable modals, and mobile-optimized touch targets.

**Planned changes:**
- Make chat component stretch to 100% screen width on mobile and Android devices
- Make chat dynamically resize when keyboard opens/closes, screen rotates, or UI dimensions change
- Fix Create New Community modal to be fully scrollable on mobile devices so all form fields are accessible
- Apply mobile-responsive touch target sizing (minimum 44px) and spacing throughout the UI for better Android usability

**User-visible outcome:** Users on Android devices can use the chat interface at full screen width with proper keyboard handling, scroll through all fields in the Create New Community modal, and interact with touch-friendly UI elements throughout the app.
