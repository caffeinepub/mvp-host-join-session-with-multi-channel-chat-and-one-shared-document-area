  "summary": "Diff adds a more explicit AppErrorBoundary UI, introduces mobile-friendly layout/overflow CSS for the session/chat view, and implements an auto-scroll state in ChannelChatView with a Switch-based toggle (plus an extra scroll-to-bottom affordance per file summary). However, the underlying root cause fix for the post-deployment “Initializing…” load hang is not evidenced in the provided diff snippets.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the post-deployment runtime error that prevents the app from loading (stuck on “Initializing…”) so the app reliably renders the Lobby/Session UI and does not fail during initialization.",
      "reason": "The diff shows improved error boundary messaging and recovery actions, but does not show the actual initialization/runtime error being fixed (e.g., the code path that previously threw/hung during app init). No concrete change to the initialization flow is evidenced in the provided snippets.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/app/AppErrorBoundary.tsx",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions App.tsx has auth/init flow but no App.tsx diff shown)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Provide an auto-scroll toggle control near the message input with an English label/tooltip and accessible aria-label.",
      "reason": "ChannelChatView imports Switch and Label and tracks autoScroll state, but the truncated diff does not show the rendered toggle control markup, so the presence of an English label/tooltip and an aria-label cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/chat/ChannelChatView.tsx (truncated)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions auto-scroll toggle, but not its accessibility attributes)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Scroll-to-bottom button when auto-scroll is disabled.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 asks for a user-controlled toggle near the input; it does not request an additional scroll-to-bottom button/CTA. This may be beneficial, but it is extra behavior beyond the stated requirements.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (ChannelChatView: \"scroll-to-bottom button when auto-scroll is disabled\")"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Error boundary action to “Clear Local Data & Reload”.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 requires a recoverable error state via the error boundary, but does not explicitly request a local-data clearing control. This is additional recovery functionality beyond the requirement text.",
