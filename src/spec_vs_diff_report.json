  "summary": "The diff adds a localStorage-backed utility for tracking hidden (removed) community IDs and wires its storage key into the existing clear-local-data flow. However, the provided diff summary is truncated for CommunitiesHubPage.tsx, so there is insufficient evidence that the UI removal action, confirmation dialog behavior, immediate removal in the My Communities grid, and isolation from the Discover section are fully implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "In the Communities Hub page, allow the user to remove (hide/delete) an existing community card from the \"My Communities\" section, with a clear remove action, immediate UI removal, and an English confirmation step.",
      "reason": "CommunitiesHubPage.tsx is truncated; the diff summary only shows imports (including Dialog, X icon, and addHiddenCommunityId/loadHiddenCommunityIds) and the static community arrays, but does not show any rendered remove control per card, confirmation dialog wiring, or list update logic.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/CommunitiesHubPage.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Persist the user’s removed \"My Communities\" state locally so removed communities stay removed after page refresh/reload, entirely on the frontend; clearing local persistence should restore the default list.",
      "reason": "While localStorage helpers and clearing logic are added, the diff summary does not show CommunitiesHubPage applying the persisted hidden IDs to filter the My Communities list on load/render, which is required to keep items removed after reload.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure the removal behavior only affects the \"My Communities\" section and does not remove or change items in the \"Discover\" section.",
      "reason": "Because CommunitiesHubPage.tsx is truncated, there is no visible evidence that the hidden/removed ID logic is scoped only to the MY_COMMUNITIES rendering and does not also filter or mutate DISCOVER_COMMUNITIES.",
