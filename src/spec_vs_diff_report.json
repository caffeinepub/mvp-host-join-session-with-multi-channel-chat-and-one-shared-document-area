  "summary": "Preview rendering and a new DocumentContentPreview component were added, but the change set appears to include backend modifications (violating the “no backend changes / tightly scoped” requirement). From the truncated diffs, some acceptance details (notably scrollability of the preview area and exact toggle labels) cannot be fully verified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Preview area is scrollable within the editor panel.",
      "reason": "The added preview component renders content in a normal <div className=\"space-y-4\"> with no visible scroll container styling; the DocumentEditorView diff is truncated before showing the preview container layout, so scrollability is not evidenced.",

      "description": "Extra project/meta files updated that are outside the requested scoped UI change (e.g., project_state.json and a repository-wide frontend-file-summaries.txt).",
