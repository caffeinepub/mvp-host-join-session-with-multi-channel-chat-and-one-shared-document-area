  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3 are largely implemented: slider range updated to 10–200 with clamping, presets updated to stay within range, and uiScale is clamped on load/save and when applied to CSS variable. A few UI enhancements (tooltips/help text) and slider step changes appear beyond the request.",

    {
      "description": "Added tooltip UI around the settings trigger button (TooltipProvider/Tooltip/TooltipContent) for 'UI Scale Settings'.",

    {
      "description": "Added explanatory help text under the presets ('Adjust the UI size for better readability...').",
      "reason": "Not requested; BuildRequest is scoped to scale range/presets/clamping and explicitly lists non-goals about adding unrelated settings.",
