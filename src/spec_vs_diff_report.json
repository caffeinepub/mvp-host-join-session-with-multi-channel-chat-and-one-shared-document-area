  "summary": "Diff implements core chat reply metadata (replyToId), long-press reply targeting, left/right message alignment, and purple reply indicator styling. However, it also introduces broad global theme/color changes in frontend/src/index.css that go beyond chat-only styling and may affect unrelated app sections.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Global app-wide color/theme palette changes (OKLCH variables, warm green accent, sidebar colors, typography tweaks) that are not limited to the chat area.",
      "reason": "REQ-6 asks for a cohesive chat visual theme and explicitly says not to change unrelated app sections; modifying global CSS variables and base element styles affects the entire app, not just chat.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "New generic global utility/style additions not explicitly requested (e.g., global code styling and heading line-height adjustments).",
      "reason": "Not part of the chat bubble/reply requirements and applies across the app, risking changes to unrelated sections.",
